The term "trading instruments" refers to various types of financial products that can be traded in the financial markets. Some common examples of trading instruments include spot and derivatives such as futures, options, and swaps.

Each type of trading instrument has its own unique characteristics, advantages, and risks. The choice of which trading instrument to use depends on various factors such as investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

## Spot
The spot market is a market where financial instruments, such as currencies, commodities, and securities, are traded for immediate delivery or settlement. In the spot market, transactions are settled "on the spot," which means the assets are bought and sold at the current market price and delivered immediately, typically within two business days. The spot market is also referred to as the cash market or the physical market, and it is different from the futures market, where financial instruments are traded for future delivery or settlement. The spot market is a critical part of the global financial system, as it provides liquidity for investors, traders, and companies to buy and sell financial assets for immediate delivery.

### Purpose of spot trading
The main purpose of spot trading is to facilitate the buying and selling of financial instruments, such as currencies, commodities, stocks, and other assets, at the current market price with immediate delivery. Spot trading involves the exchange of cash or other assets for the underlying instrument being traded. This means that the buyer pays the seller the agreed-upon price and immediately takes ownership of the underlying asset, with delivery typically occurring within a few days.

Spot trading is used by traders and investors who are looking to take advantage of short-term price movements in the markets, and who wish to quickly buy or sell an asset to capitalize on those movements. It is also used by businesses that need to make immediate purchases or sales of raw materials or other goods in order to meet their operational needs.


### Major spot markets
There are a number of major spot markets for various asset classes. Here are a few examples:

* **Foreign Exchange (Forex) market**: This is the largest and most liquid market in the world, where currency pairs are traded 24 hours a day. Some major currency pairs that are traded on the spot market include EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD.

* **Equity market**: This is where stocks of publicly traded companies are bought and sold on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and Tokyo Stock Exchange.

* **Commodity market**: This includes various commodities such as gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, and agricultural products, which are traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Metal Exchange (LME).

* **Bond market**: This is where debt securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds are traded.

* **Cryptocurrency market**: This is where digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are traded on exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.

These are just a few examples of the many spot markets that exist. Each market has its own unique characteristics and is subject to different factors that can affect supply and demand, and therefore the prices of the assets traded on them.

### Important terms
**What is settlement?**

Settlement in financial markets refers to the process of transferring funds or assets from one party to another as part of a trade or transaction. The settlement process typically follows the trade execution and involves the confirmation of the trade details, the transfer of the securities or cash, and the updating of relevant records.

Settlement is an important part of the trading process, as it ensures that both parties receive what they are owed and that the transaction is completed in a timely and efficient manner. Settlement also helps to reduce counterparty risk and systemic risk in financial markets.

## Futures
A futures market is a centralized marketplace where standardized contracts to buy or sell a specified asset or commodity at a predetermined price and date in the future are traded. In a futures contract, the buyer agrees to purchase a specific asset or commodity, and the seller agrees to deliver that asset or commodity at a specific time in the future, at a predetermined price. Futures markets are often used as a hedging tool by companies or individuals who want to lock in a future price for a commodity or asset to reduce the risk of price fluctuations. Futures markets are also used for speculative purposes, with traders betting on the future price of a commodity or asset. The most commonly traded futures markets include commodities such as oil, gold, and wheat, as well as financial instruments such as stock indexes and currency exchange rates.

### Purpose of futures trading
The main purpose of futures trading is to provide a way for market participants to manage risk and obtain price discovery for a particular asset or commodity. By trading futures contracts, buyers and sellers can agree to buy or sell a specific asset or commodity at a predetermined price on a specific date in the future. This allows market participants to hedge against potential price fluctuations in the underlying asset, locking in a price for future delivery. Additionally, futures trading can provide liquidity for the underlying asset by allowing buyers and sellers to transact in a standardized, exchange-traded contract. This can facilitate more efficient price discovery and reduce transaction costs for market participants.

### Major Futures Markets
Futures contracts are commonly used to trade commodities such as agricultural products, metals, energy, and financial instruments like stock indices, currencies, cryptocurrencies and interest rates. Some of the most heavily traded futures markets include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which offers contracts for products such as crude oil, gold, and corn, and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which offers contracts for products such as natural gas, Brent crude oil, and coffee. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is another major futures exchange, offering contracts for energy and metal products. Additionally, futures contracts are also used to trade financial instruments, such as stock indices (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq), bonds, and currencies.

### Important terms
**Open interest**

Open interest in the futures market is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled by an offsetting transaction or delivery. This is essentially the number of futures contracts that are currently held by traders and investors in the market.

Open interest is a useful metric for understanding the level of participation and sentiment in a particular futures market. It can be used to track changes in market sentiment and to identify potential trends in market activity. For example, an increase in open interest may signal a growing trend in the market, while a decrease in open interest may indicate a decline in trading activity or a shift in market sentiment. Open interest is often used in conjunction with price and volume data to analyze market activity and inform trading decisions.

**Contango**

Contango refers to a situation in which the prices of futures contracts for delivery further in the future are higher than the prices of contracts for near-term delivery. This is a normal condition in a market with a sufficient supply of the underlying asset. The cost of storing the asset until the delivery date (such as warehousing or insurance) is incorporated into the futures price, so distant-month contracts trade at a premium to spot prices.

**Backwardation**

Backwardation on the other hand, refers to a situation in which near-term futures contracts are priced higher than futures contracts for delivery further in the future. This occurs when the market perceives a shortage of the underlying asset. In such situations, the immediate demand for the asset drives up the price of near-term futures contracts, creating a situation where distant-month contracts are priced lower than spot prices.

## Options
In finance, an option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified price on or before a specified date. The underlying asset can be a stock, commodity, currency, index, or other financial instrument. The specified price, or strike price, is the price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold, depending on the type of option. Options can be used for hedging or speculating on price movements of the underlying asset.

### Type of options
There are two main types of options: call options and put options. 

**Call option**
A call option is a type of financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specified time frame. The buyer of a call option is betting that the price of the underlying asset will rise, allowing them to buy it at a lower price than the market price. If the price of the underlying asset does not rise above the strike price, the buyer of the call option can choose not to use the option and simply let it expire worthless. However, if the price of the underlying asset does rise above the strike price, the buyer of the call option can use their right to buy the asset at the lower price, and then sell it at the higher market price to make a profit.

**Put options**
A put option is a financial contract between a buyer and a seller, which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset (such as a stock, index, or commodity) to the seller at a specified price within a specified time period.

In other words, a put option is a type of financial contract that allows the holder of the option to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specified time frame (known as the expiration date). The holder of the put option hopes to profit from a decline in the price of the underlying asset. If the price of the underlying asset falls below the strike price, the holder can buy the asset at the lower market price and then sell it to the seller of the put option at the higher strike price, realizing a profit. However, if the price of the underlying asset does not fall below the strike price, the holder of the put option may choose not to use the option, allowing it to expire worthless.

### Purpose of options trading
The main purpose of options is to provide traders and investors with the ability to manage risk and speculate on the price movements of underlying assets. Options are contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date).

Options can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* **Hedging**: Options can be used to protect against potential losses in an existing position. For example, an investor who owns a stock and is concerned about a potential decline in its value can buy a put option to limit their potential losses.

* **Speculation**: Options can be used to make directional bets on the price movements of an underlying asset. For example, a trader who believes that a stock is going to rise can buy a call option to profit from the price increase.

* **Generating income**: Options can also be used to generate income by selling (writing) options. For example, a trader can sell a covered call option on a stock they own to generate income from the option premium.

Overall, the use of options depends on the specific objectives of the trader or investor and their risk tolerance.

### Major options markets
There are several major options markets around the world. Some of the largest and most active options markets include:

* **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)** - located in the United States, it is the largest options exchange in the world, and it trades options on a variety of financial instruments such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and indexes.

* **Eurex** - located in Europe, it is one of the largest options exchanges in the world, trading options on a wide range of underlying assets, including stocks, bonds, and indexes.

* **Osaka Exchange (OSE)** - located in Japan, it is the largest derivatives exchange in the country, and it trades options on a variety of financial instruments, including stocks, indexes, and commodities.

* **Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX)** - located in Hong Kong, it is one of the largest options exchanges in Asia, trading options on stocks, ETFs, and indexes.

* **Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE)** - located in Australia, it trades options on a range of financial instruments, including equities, indexes, and commodities.

### Important terms
**Selling (writing) options**
Selling or writing an option refers to the act of creating or selling an options contract to another party. When someone sells an option, they are obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract if the other party chooses to use the option. In exchange for taking on this obligation, the seller of the option collects a premium from the buyer of the option.

For example, if someone sells a call option, they are giving the buyer the right to purchase a specific asset at a set price (the strike price) on or before a specific date (the expiration date). In exchange for this right, the buyer pays a premium to the seller. If the buyer uses the option, the seller must deliver the asset at the strike price.

Similarly, if someone sells a put option, they are giving the buyer the right to sell a specific asset at a set price on or before a specific date. If the buyer uses the option, the seller must buy the asset at the strike price.

Selling options can be a way to generate income, but it also involves taking on risk, as the seller may be obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract at a loss. Therefore, it is important for sellers to have a thorough understanding of the risks involved and to carefully manage their positions.

* **At-the-money (ATM)** - an option whose strike price is exactly that of where the underlying is trading. ATM options have a delta of 0.50.
* **In-the-money (ITM)** - an option with intrinsic value, and a delta greater than 0.50. For a call, the strike price of an ITM option will be below the current price of the underlying; for a put, above the current price.
* **Out-of-the-money (OTM)** - an option with only extrinsic (time) value and a delta a less than 0.50. For a call, the strike price of an OTM option will be above the current price of the underlying; for a put, below the current price.
* **Premium** - the price paid for an option in the market
* **Strike price** - the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying, also known as the exercise price.
* **Underlying** - the security upon which the option is based
* **Implied volatility (IV)** - the volatility of the underlying (how quickly and severely it moves), as revealed by market prices
* **Exercise** - when an options contract owner exercises the right to buy or sell at the strike price. The seller is then said to be assigned.
* **Expiration** - the date at which the options contract expires, or ceases to exist. OTM options will expire worthless.

## ETF
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment fund that trades on a stock exchange like a regular stock. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they typically hold a portfolio of assets such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, but they differ in the way they are bought and sold, and in their expense structure.

Like a mutual fund, an ETF allows investors to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, but they can be bought and sold throughout the day on a stock exchange like individual stocks, and their management fees are typically lower. ETFs can be structured in various ways, such as passive index-tracking funds or actively managed funds. ETFs can also specialize in certain sectors or investment themes, making them a popular tool for diversification or targeted exposure.

### Purpose of ETF trading
The purpose of the ETF market is to provide investors with a way to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of securities, while also enjoying the flexibility and liquidity of trading individual shares on an exchange. ETFs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, sector, commodity, or other underlying asset, and their prices generally move in line with the value of the underlying assets. ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, like individual stocks, making them a convenient and cost-effective way to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. They can also be used for a variety of investment strategies, such as hedging, speculation, and income generation.

### Major ETF markets
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) cover a wide range of asset classes and investment strategies, so the most traded ETFs can vary depending on the market conditions and investor preferences at any given time. However, here are a few examples of some of the most traded ETFs in recent years:

* **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: Tracks the S&P 500 index, one of the most widely used benchmarks for U.S. large-cap equities.
* **Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)**: Tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange.
* **Vanguard Total World Stock ETF**: The fund is designed to track the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap Index, which includes large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks from developed and emerging markets around the world.

### Large ETF providers by traded volume
Some of the largest ETF providers by traded volume in the world include BlackRock (iShares), Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors (SPDR), Invesco, and Charles Schwab. These providers have a broad range of ETF offerings covering various asset classes, sectors, and investment themes. BlackRock and Vanguard are the two largest providers of ETFs in terms of assets under management.

## CFD
CFD stands for "Contract for Difference". CFD trading is a form of derivative trading where you speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, such as a stock, index, currency pair or commodity, without actually owning the underlying asset itself.

In a CFD trade, you enter into an agreement with a broker to exchange the difference in the price of an asset between the time the contract is opened and the time it is closed. If the price of the asset moves in the direction you predicted, you make a profit; if it moves against you, you incur a loss. CFD trading allows you to go long (buy) or short (sell) on an asset, meaning you can potentially profit from both rising and falling prices.

CFD trading is popular among traders due to its flexibility, high leverage, and ability to access a wide range of markets. However, it also carries a higher level of risk than traditional trading and is not suitable for everyone.

### Purpose of CFD trading
The purpose of CFD trading is to speculate on the price movements of various financial instruments, such as stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices, without actually owning the underlying assets. Traders use CFDs to take long or short positions in these assets, meaning they can profit from both rising and falling markets. CFDs allow traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a larger position in the market than their capital would allow. However, trading CFDs also carries risks, including the potential for significant losses due to leverage and the high volatility of some of the underlying assets.

### Major CFD providers by trading volume
There are several CFD providers that are popular and have high trading volumes. Some of the major CFD providers include:

* **IG Group**: A UK-based company that provides CFD trading, spread betting, and share dealing services. It is one of the largest CFD providers in the world, with a significant market share in the UK and Europe.

* **Plus500**: An Israel-based company that provides CFD trading services for a wide range of financial instruments, including stocks, indices, commodities, and currencies. It has a strong presence in Europe and Asia.

* **CMC Markets**: A UK-based company that provides CFD trading, spread betting, and forex trading services. It has a significant presence in the UK, Europe, and Australia.

* **Saxo Bank**: A Danish investment bank that provides CFD trading, forex trading, and other investment services. It has a strong presence in Europe and Asia.

* **eToro**: An Israeli social trading platform that allows users to trade CFDs on a wide range of financial instruments, including stocks, currencies, and commodities. It has a large user base and is popular among retail traders.

### Disadvantages CFD trading over futures market
Here are some potential disadvantages of CFD trading compared to futures trading:

* **Margin requirements**: CFD brokers often require lower margin deposits than futures brokers, which can make CFDs seem more accessible to traders. However, this also means that traders may be taking on more leverage and risk than they realize.

* **Pricing and spreads**: CFD prices and spreads may not always reflect the underlying market, particularly during periods of high volatility. Futures prices, on the other hand, are typically more transparent and reflect the actual supply and demand dynamics of the market.

* **Limited contract options**: CFDs often have limited contract options compared to futures, which can limit trading flexibility.

* **Counterparty risk**: When trading CFDs, you are trading with a broker as the counterparty to your trade, and there is a risk that the broker may not fulfill their obligations. Futures contracts, on the other hand, are traded on exchanges and are guaranteed by clearinghouses, which reduces counterparty risk.

* **Regulatory environment**: The regulatory environment for CFD trading can be less robust than the regulatory environment for futures trading. This can create a higher risk of fraud or other types of misconduct.

### Important terms
**Conflict of interest when trade CFD with broker**
There can potentially be a conflict of interest between traders and brokers when trading CFDs, as the broker is usually the counterparty to the trade. When traders open a CFD position, they do not actually own the underlying asset, but rather enter into an agreement with the broker to exchange the difference in the price of the underlying asset between the opening and closing of the trade.

Since the broker is on the other side of the trade, their profits come from the spread (the difference between the buy and sell prices) and the commissions and fees they charge. This means that the broker may have an incentive to trade against the client, or take actions that benefit the broker's bottom line rather than the client's best interest. This could potentially create a conflict of interest.

## Forwards
In finance, a forward contract is a non-standardized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on a future date. It is a type of derivative that is used to hedge against future price movements of an asset. The buyer and seller of the forward contract agree to the terms of the contract, including the price and the expiration date, at the time of entering into the contract. The asset underlying the contract could be a commodity, a currency, a stock, or any other financial instrument. Forward contracts are commonly used by traders, investors, and corporations to manage their exposure to price movements in various markets.

## Swaps
In finance, a swap is a derivative contract that allows two parties to exchange financial instruments, cash flows, or liabilities. Swaps can be used for hedging, speculation, or to help manage risk.

The most common type of swap is an interest rate swap, where two parties exchange interest payments on a notional amount of principal for a specified period of time. Other types of swaps include currency swaps, commodity swaps, equity swaps, and credit default swaps, among others.

In a currency swap, for example, two parties exchange an equivalent amount of principal in different currencies and then agree to exchange the principal and interest payments back at a future date at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The purpose of a currency swap is often to hedge against currency exchange rate risk.
