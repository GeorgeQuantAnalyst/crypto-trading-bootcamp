# Type of analysis markets
Updated: 6.3.2023 by Lucy

There are two main types of analysis used in financial markets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Another one is psychology analysis. Both fundamental and technical analysis can be used to make investment decisions in financial markets, and many investors use a combination of both approaches. However, there are some key differences between the two approaches, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Fundamental analysis is often used for long-term investing and can provide a more comprehensive view of a company or industry. However, it can be time-consuming and may not be as useful for short-term trading. Technical analysis, on the other hand, is often used for short-term trading and can provide more immediate signals for buying and selling decisions. However, it can be more subjective and may not provide as much context about the underlying factors driving market movements.

## Technical analysis
It involves analyzing past market data, such as price and volume, to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future market movements. Technical analysts use charts and other tools to visualize market data and identify potential buying and selling opportunities.

### Example
One example of technical analysis is the use of chart patterns to identify potential buying or selling opportunities in financial markets. Chart patterns are visual representations of past market data, such as price and volume, that can help traders identify trends and predict future price movements.

For example, one commonly used chart pattern is the "head and shoulders" pattern, which consists of a series of peaks and troughs that resemble the shape of a head and two shoulders. This pattern is considered to be a bearish signal, indicating that the price of the asset may be poised to fall.

Another example of technical analysis is the use of technical indicators, which are mathematical calculations based on past market data that can be used to identify potential buying or selling opportunities. Examples of technical indicators include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and stochastic oscillators.

For instance, a trader might use the RSI indicator to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a security. If the RSI reaches a value of 70 or higher, it may suggest that the security is overbought and due for a price correction, while an RSI value of 30 or lower may indicate that the security is oversold and could be a good buying opportunity.

Overall, technical analysis can be a powerful tool for traders and investors to identify potential market opportunities and manage risk. However, it should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis, and traders should always be aware of the potential limitations and risks of relying solely on technical analysis.

## Fundamental analysis
It involves analyzing the financial and economic factors that can affect the price of a security, such as company financial statements, industry trends, macroeconomic indicators, and geopolitical events. Fundamental analysts use this information to evaluate the intrinsic value of a security and make investment decisions based on their assessment of its long-term potential.

### Example
One example of fundamental analysis is the evaluation of a company's financial statements to determine its intrinsic value and long-term growth potential. Financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement can provide valuable information about a company's revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows.

For instance, an investor might use fundamental analysis to evaluate a company's revenue growth over time, its profit margins, its debt levels, and its earnings per share (EPS). By analyzing these factors, the investor can gain insights into the company's financial health, profitability, and ability to generate cash flows over the long term.

Another example of fundamental analysis is the evaluation of macroeconomic factors that can affect a company's industry or the broader market. For instance, an investor might consider the impact of interest rates, inflation, government regulations, or global economic conditions on the company's operations and profitability.

Fundamental analysts may also consider non-financial factors, such as management quality, competitive advantages, and market share, in their evaluation of a company's long-term potential.

Overall, fundamental analysis is a useful tool for long-term investors who are interested in evaluating the underlying health and prospects of a company or industry. It can provide a more comprehensive view of a company's financial position and potential risks and opportunities, and can help investors make informed investment decisions based on their assessment of the company's intrinsic value.

## Psychology analysis
Psychology analysis is a type of analysis that focuses on the emotions and behaviors of market participants, such as traders and investors. It recognizes that market movements are often driven not just by economic and financial factors, but also by human emotions such as fear, greed, and optimism.

Psychology analysis can involve the study of individual or group behavior, as well as the impact of media and social trends on market sentiment. For instance, an analyst might study the behavior of traders during a market downturn to determine whether fear or panic is driving the selling pressure, or the impact of social media posts on the sentiment of retail investors.

### Example
One example of psychology analysis is the study of investor sentiment and its impact on market movements. When investors are optimistic and confident, they are more likely to buy stocks and push up market prices, while when they are fearful or uncertain, they may be more likely to sell and drive down prices.

One commonly used tool for measuring investor sentiment is the Fear and Greed Index, which tracks a range of indicators such as stock market volatility, junk bond demand, and put/call ratios to provide a snapshot of market sentiment. For example, if the index is showing high levels of fear, it may suggest that investors are concerned about a potential market downturn and are selling off their positions.

Another example of psychology analysis is the study of individual behavior patterns, such as those exhibited by day traders or momentum traders. These traders often make decisions based on emotions such as fear or greed, rather than on fundamental or technical analysis. By studying these behavior patterns, analysts can gain insights into how market movements may be influenced by human emotions and biases.

For instance, an analyst might study the behavior of a specific group of traders during a market downturn to determine whether they are selling due to fear or panic, or whether they are following a specific trading strategy that is driving their decision-making process.

Overall, psychology analysis can provide valuable insights into the emotions and behavior patterns that can drive market movements. It can help traders and investors understand the impact of sentiment on market prices and identify potential opportunities or risks. However, psychology analysis should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and should be approached with a critical and objective mindset.
