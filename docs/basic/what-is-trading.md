Trading refers to the exchange of goods or assets between two or more parties. This can take place in a variety of contexts, such as buying and selling securities on a stock exchange, bartering for goods or services, or buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market. Trading can be conducted by individuals, institutions, or businesses, and it can take place in person, over the phone, or online. The goal of trading is typically to generate profits by buying low and selling high, or by taking advantage of price differences in different markets.


## Type of trading styles

There are several different types of trading styles that exist in the financial markets. Some of the most common include:

* **Scalping**: A fast-paced style of trading that involves making multiple trades within a short time frame, often just a few seconds or minutes. Scalpers look to profit from small price movements and typically use high levels of leverage to maximize returns.

* **Day Trading**: This style involves holding positions for only a single day, with the goal of taking advantage of short-term price movements. Day traders usually close out all of their positions before the end of the trading day.

* **Swing Trading**: A style that involves holding positions for a few days to several weeks. Swing traders look to profit from intermediate-term price movements and tend to use technical analysis to make their trading decisions.

* **Position Trading**: A longer-term approach that involves holding positions for several weeks, months, or even years. Position traders look to profit from long-term trends in the market and typically use fundamental analysis to inform their trading decisions.

* **Algorithmic Trading**: This style involves using computer algorithms to make trading decisions based on mathematical models and complex calculations. Algorithmic traders often employ high-frequency trading strategies to take advantage of market inefficiencies.

Each trading style has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the right style for a particular trader will depend on their goals, personality, and level of experience.

## What is better intraday trading one/two assets or build portfolio for swing trading?
Deciding whether to engage in intraday trading or swing trading with a portfolio of assets depends on several factors, including your personal trading style, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

Intraday trading involves buying and selling assets within the same trading day, with the goal of profiting from short-term price movements. It requires close attention to the markets and quick decision-making skills. Intraday trading can be risky due to the high volatility of short-term price movements, but it also offers the potential for quick profits.

On the other hand, swing trading involves holding assets for a longer period of time, typically from a few days to several weeks, in order to take advantage of price movements that occur over the medium term. Swing trading can be less stressful than intraday trading since it allows for more time to analyze the markets and make trading decisions. It also provides the opportunity to take advantage of larger price movements that may occur over several days or weeks.

Building a portfolio for swing trading can provide diversification benefits and potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. It allows you to take advantage of price movements across multiple assets, rather than relying on the performance of a single asset. However, building a portfolio requires more research and analysis to identify the assets with the greatest potential for price appreciation.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your individual preferences, trading style, and investment goals. Both intraday trading and swing trading can be profitable if executed with a well-developed trading plan, appropriate risk management strategies, and a disciplined approach to trading.
