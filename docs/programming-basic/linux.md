Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is widely used for servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems, as well as desktop and laptop computers.

One of the key features of Linux is its open-source nature, which means that the source code for the operating system is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone. This has led to the development of a large and active community of developers who contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the operating system.

Linux is used by a variety of organizations and individuals, from large corporations and governments to individual users and hobbyists. It is particularly popular for web servers, as well as for scientific computing and other data-intensive applications.
