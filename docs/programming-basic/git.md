Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to files and collaborate with other people on software development projects. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to help manage the development of the Linux kernel, but it has since become widely adopted in the software development industry.

With Git, you can create a copy of a project's code repository on your local machine, make changes to it, and then push those changes back to the remote repository so that others can see and incorporate them. Git also provides tools for managing conflicts that may arise when multiple people are working on the same code, and it allows you to easily roll back to previous versions of your code if necessary.
