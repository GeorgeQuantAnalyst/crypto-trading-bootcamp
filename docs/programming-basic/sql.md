SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query relational databases and is the standard language used in most relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL allows users to interact with the database by retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a structured and efficient manner. SQL commands are used to create tables, define relationships between tables, insert and retrieve data from tables, and perform calculations and other operations on data in tables. SQL is a powerful language for working with data, and is used extensively in data analysis, business intelligence, and software development.
