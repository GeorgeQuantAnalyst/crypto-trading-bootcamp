# Fundamental analysis
{: .no_toc }

Fundamental analysis is a method of analyzing financial markets by examining the underlying economic and financial factors that influence asset prices. The goal of fundamental analysis is to determine the intrinsic value of an asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, based on factors such as its earnings, cash flow, growth prospects, competition, and the overall health of the economy.
