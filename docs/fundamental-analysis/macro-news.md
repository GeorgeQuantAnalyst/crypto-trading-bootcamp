Fundamental analysis is a method of analyzing financial markets by examining the underlying economic and financial factors that influence asset prices. The goal of fundamental analysis is to determine the intrinsic value of an asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, based on factors such as its earnings, cash flow, growth prospects, competition, and the overall health of the economy.

In stock market analysis, fundamental analysis typically involves examining a company's financial statements, such as its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, to assess its financial health and performance. Analysts will also look at broader economic indicators, such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth, to assess the overall health of the economy and the market as a whole.

Fundamental analysis can also be used to analyze other financial markets, such as the foreign exchange market, bond market, and commodity markets, by examining the underlying economic factors that influence prices in these markets.

## Advantages vs Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

* fundamental analysis focuses on a longer-term outlook on the economic situation of a specific country or company
* saves the time of the trader from monitoring the trading platform and the current price movement in the markets

**Disadvantages:**
* need a lot of time for thorough analysis, not applicable for intraday trading
* subjective and shows a general view, i.e. direction not exact entries and exits from positions for this is good technical analysis which is subsequently used to determine entry and exit
* suitable for longer-term deals

## The most important macroeconomic reports
Ordered from the most important with the greatest impact on the markets.

### Interest rate
- whoever sets the monetary policy and interest rates for a given country on Forex, usually central banks, is more important than the head of state
- by interest rate we mean the rate that central banks offer for saving money
- it is the minimum interest rate that investors will seek for investing in securities
- a change in the interest rate affects the exchange rate of the given currency, traditionally a higher interest rate in the country attracts foreign capital and strengthens the currency
- likewise, a high interest rate leads to less availability of financial resources, which could increase the value of the currency and vice versa

For example: on May 7, the central bank of Australia reduced the interest rate by 25 percentage points to a record low of 2.75% in order to stimulate economic growth -> fundamentally, this event means a weakening of the currency against other currencies,

### HDP
- is the total amount of goods and services produced in a given country/region for a certain period of time
- it is reported quarterly, and this GDP growth is a basic indicator of the economic development of the given country and is directly reflected in the value of the given country's currency
- a strong GDP number tends to strengthen the domestic currency and a weak GDP to its weakening

### Inflation
- growth in prices of goods and services over a certain period of time
- prime and significant impact on foreign exchange markets
- higher inflation reduces the purchasing power of the currency, and countries with lower inflation show an increasing value of the currency
- if countries experience a sustained fall in the world, inflation means a longer-term decrease in demand for goods and services due to weak economic factors that push down the currency of the given nation
- if the inflation of the given state has been declining for a long time and then suddenly rises, this means a positive signal
- the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure inflation

### Enployment rate
- the unemployment rate shows us how much of the population is employed out of the total workforce of a certain nation/region
- the unemployment rate has an immediate impact on economic growth
- an increase in the unemployment rate or a decrease in employment is considered a sign of weak economic activity or a slowdown in the economy
- high unemployment could lead to a delay in raising interest rates by central banks or even to a reduction in interest rates, which would reduce the value of the currency

### Trade balance
- measures the net import or export the country
- essential part of economic information on foreign exchange markets
- the trade balance shows the difference between the value of all goods and services exported to other countries and the value of all goods and services imported from abroad
- trade deficit is a situation when the trade balance is negative (the country imports more goods than it exports)
- on the contrary, if the trade balance is positive, we have a trade surplus (the value of exports is greater than the value of imports)
- a trade deficit will generally contribute to the weakening of the currency, because it leads to the sale of domestic currency, which is necessary to pay import duties
- a positive trade balance is for the domestic menu

### Political factors
- upcoming elections are always an important event and can have a really big impact on the currency market
- especially during geopolitical unrest, Forex traders are looking for a safe haven
