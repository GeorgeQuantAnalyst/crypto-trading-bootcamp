Order flow analysis is a technique used in financial markets to analyze the trading orders that are placed by buyers and sellers. This approach focuses on the actual trades being executed and looks at the order book and time and sales data to determine the flow of orders and how they are affecting the market.

The goal of order flow analysis is to gain insight into the supply and demand dynamics of a market and to identify potential trading opportunities based on this information. By analyzing order flow data, traders can gain a better understanding of the market's structure and the behavior of other market participants, which can help them make more informed trading decisions.

Order flow analysis is commonly used in conjunction with other forms of technical and fundamental analysis to form a complete picture of a market's dynamics. It is used by traders in a variety of markets, including equities, futures, and foreign exchange.
