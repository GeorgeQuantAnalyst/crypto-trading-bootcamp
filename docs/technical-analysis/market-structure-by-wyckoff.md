The Wyckoff market structure is a methodology of analyzing financial markets that was developed by Richard D. Wyckoff in the early 20th century. Wyckoff believed that price movements in financial markets were driven by supply and demand forces and that these forces could be analyzed and predicted based on the behavior of market participants. The Wyckoff method is based on a number of principles, including the idea that markets move in cycles and that the behavior of institutional traders can be used to predict market trends. The method involves analyzing price and volume data to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and accumulation and distribution patterns. Traders using the Wyckoff method seek to identify buying and selling opportunities based on changes in market structure and the behavior of market participants.
