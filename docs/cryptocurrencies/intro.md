### What is cryptocurrencies?
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate independently of a central bank. They are decentralized and typically built on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions made on the network. The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are many other types of cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. Cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on digital currency exchanges, and can also be used to purchase goods and services online. Transactions made with cryptocurrencies are recorded on a public ledger and are verified by a network of computers, making them more secure and transparent than traditional forms of currency.

### What most used cryptocurrencies?
The most widely used cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, and it remains the largest by market capitalization. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is known for its smart contract functionality. Tether is a stablecoin, meaning it is pegged to the value of the US dollar, and is often used as a store of value or a means of exchange on cryptocurrency exchanges. Other notable cryptocurrencies include Binance Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP. However, the crypto market is constantly changing and new coins are emerging frequently.

### What are cryptocurrencies used for?
Cryptocurrencies are primarily used as a digital medium of exchange. They are decentralized and operate on a blockchain network, which is a distributed ledger technology that records and verifies transactions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to make purchases, transfer money, and store value. They can also be used for more advanced applications such as smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Some people also use cryptocurrencies as an investment, buying and holding them with the expectation that their value will increase over time. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 with the goal of providing a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

**Digital currencies, Supply chain management, and Voting systems**

### What is blockchain?
A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is decentralized and distributed across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction is added to the block, it is broadcast to the entire network. Each block is linked to the block before it and after it, creating a chain of blocks. This creates a transparent and secure way of recording and verifying transactions, as each block in the chain is protected by complex cryptography.

One of the key features of a blockchain is that it is immutable, meaning that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes it a very useful technology for a variety of different applications, such as digital currencies, supply chain management, and voting systems. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, is based on blockchain technology.

### What is smart contract and dApp?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. It is a computer program that automatically executes the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts allow for the automation of processes and can be used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

A decentralized application (dApp) is a type of application that runs on a blockchain network. dApps are decentralized because they are not controlled by any single entity. Instead, they rely on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, typically a blockchain, to run. dApps are open-source and are typically built on top of a blockchain platform like Ethereum. They can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as creating decentralized marketplaces, digital voting systems, and more.

### What is purpose of smart contract in real life?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist over a decentralized, blockchain network.

In real life, smart contracts can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial derivatives, supply chain management, real estate, and more. For example, in supply chain management, a smart contract could be used to automatically release payment to a supplier upon delivery of goods. In real estate, a smart contract could be used to automate the process of transferring ownership of a property. Additionally, smart contracts can be used for voting systems, digital identity, and other applications where secure and transparent record-keeping is important.

## Crypto sectors
Crypto sectors refer to the different areas or industries in which cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are being used or applied. Some examples of crypto sectors include:

* **Payment and transactions**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies that are primarily used as a form of payment or for sending and receiving money, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.

* **Decentralized finance (DeFi)**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based platforms that enable decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Ethereum is a significant player in this sector.

* **Privacy**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies that prioritize user privacy and anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash.

* **Stablecoins**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency or other stable asset, such as Tether.

* **Supply Chain Management**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based platforms that are used to improve supply chain transparency, traceability, and efficiency.

* **Gaming**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based platforms that are used in the gaming industry for in-game purchases, digital collectibles, and other use cases.

* **Metaverse**

The term "metaverse" is often used to describe the concept of a virtual world or universe that is created and sustained by computer technology. In the context of the cryptocurrency sector, the term "metaverse crypto" generally refers to a subset of digital assets and projects that are focused on building out the infrastructure and applications for decentralized virtual worlds and online communities. This can include things like virtual reality platforms, decentralized marketplaces, and other blockchain-based applications that are designed to enable new forms of social interaction and economic activity in virtual environments.

Examples of projects in the metaverse crypto sector include Decentraland, Somnium Space, and The Sandbox, all of which are decentralized virtual worlds built on the Ethereum blockchain. These platforms allow users to create, buy, and sell virtual real estate, virtual goods, and other digital assets, and also provide a space for social interactions and online communities.

* **NFT**

NFT, which stands for Non-Fungible Token, is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item or piece of content, such as a digital art, video, music, or other types of media. NFTs are typically built on top of blockchain technology, which enables them to be traded and exchanged in a decentralized, trustless manner. Because they are unique and cannot be replaced by another identical item, they are considered non-fungible, which is where the name comes from. The NFT crypto sector is a rapidly growing area within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many creators, artists, and musicians finding ways to monetize their work through NFTs.

* **Web3**

Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, is the next evolution of the internet where users have more control over their data and digital assets, and where decentralized technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts play a major role. The Web 3.0 crypto sector refers to the various blockchain-based projects and protocols that are building the infrastructure and applications for this new decentralized web. This includes decentralized storage, decentralized finance, decentralized identity, and decentralized marketplaces. Some examples of projects in the Web 3.0 crypto sector include Ethereum, IPFS, and 0x Protocol.

* **Layer 1**

The "layer 1" crypto sector refers to the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain network. This includes the protocol and consensus mechanism that ensure the security and integrity of the network, as well as the mechanisms for validating transactions and creating new blocks. Bitcoin, for example, is considered a layer 1 blockchain, as it has its own protocol and consensus mechanism (proof-of-work) that is not built on top of any other blockchain. Ethereum is also considered a layer 1 blockchain, with its own protocol and consensus mechanism (proof-of-stake). Layer 1 blockchain networks are considered the foundation or backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, and they are usually the most secure and decentralized compared to layer 2 or layer 3 solutions.

* **Layer 2**

The layer 2 sector of the cryptocurrency space refers to projects that aim to provide solutions to the scalability and transactional issues faced by layer 1 protocols, while still leveraging their security and decentralization benefits. Layer 2 solutions typically aim to offload some of the computational and transactional demands of layer 1 protocols onto secondary layers of the network, making it possible to handle more transactions and reduce the costs associated with on-chain activity. Some examples of layer 2 solutions include state channels, plasma chains, and rollups. These solutions can be used to power decentralized applications, facilitate faster and cheaper payments, and enable new use cases that may not have been possible with layer 1 protocols alone.

* **Layer 3**

"Layer 3" refers to solutions that are built on top of layer 2 solutions, and aims to provide more advanced functionality to the blockchain. They allow for more complex dApps and use cases. However, Layer 3 solutions are still in development and research phase, and are not yet widely adopted.

## Mechanism consensus
In cryptocurrencies, a consensus mechanism is a method used to achieve agreement among participants in a decentralized network about the current state of the system. The goal of a consensus mechanism is to ensure that all participants in the network have the same view of the ledger, even in the presence of malicious actors or network failures.

### Proof of Work
Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used by some cryptocurrencies to secure their networks and validate transactions. It is based on the idea that a user must perform a certain amount of computational work in order to participate in the network and validate transactions. The computational work involves solving complex mathematical problems that are difficult to perform but easy to verify. Once a user solves the problem, they can add a block to the blockchain and receive a reward for their effort.

The PoW consensus mechanism is used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (prior to transitioning to Proof of Stake), and others. The computational work performed during PoW provides the computational power required to secure the network and validate transactions, making it resistant to malicious attacks such as 51% attacks, where an attacker tries to control the majority of computational power on the network to carry out malicious activities.

### Proof of Stake
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used in some cryptocurrencies as an alternative to Proof of Work (PoW). Unlike PoW, which requires nodes (or "miners") to perform a computational effort in order to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, PoS relies on nodes holding a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to validate transactions and secure the network.

In a PoS system, the node with the most "stake" (or amount of cryptocurrency) is chosen to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, rather than the node that performs the most computational work. The idea behind this is that a node with a large amount of stake has a financial incentive to act honestly and maintain the security of the network, since a malicious node would risk losing its stake.

PoS is often considered to be more energy-efficient than PoW, since it does not require a large amount of computational effort to validate transactions. This makes it an attractive option for cryptocurrencies that are looking to scale and reduce their environmental impact.

### Proof of authority
Proof of Authority (PoA) is a consensus mechanism used in some blockchain networks. In a PoA system, certain designated nodes, or validators, are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. The validators are typically chosen based on their reputation or identity, hence the name "Proof of Authority."

In a PoA system, the validators are trusted to perform their duties in a honest and reliable manner, as they are known and publicly identified entities. This can help ensure a higher level of security compared to proof of work consensus, where the validity of transactions is determined through cryptographic algorithms and computing power.

Proof of Authority can be a good choice for blockchain networks that have a smaller number of participants, as it does not require the same level of computational power as proof of work and can help ensure faster block times and lower energy consumption.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) allows token holders to vote for delegates to make decisions on behalf of the network. This consensus mechanism is designed to be fast, efficient, and secure while enabling the Binance ecosystem to scale and accommodate a large number of transactions.

In the DPoS mechanism, token holders vote for a limited number of delegate nodes, which then validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. The process of creating new blocks and securing the network is done by these delegate nodes, rather than the entire network, making it a more efficient and scalable solution compared to other consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW).

### Proof of Reserve
The Proof of Reserve mechanism is used to ensure that the Tether token is fully backed by US dollars held in reserve. This means that for every Tether token in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve to back it. The Proof of Reserve mechanism provides assurance to Tether users that their tokens can be redeemed for US dollars, making Tether a stablecoin.

### XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol
This consensus mechanism is based on a network of nodes that maintain a distributed ledger of all transactions on the XRP network. Transactions are validated by nodes through a process called consensus, and once a transaction is validated, it is recorded permanently on the ledger. The XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol is designed to be energy efficient, fast, and secure, making it a suitable choice for the XRP cryptocurrency.

### Proof of History
PoH is a time-stamping mechanism that generates a unique, verifiable hash for each block, allowing nodes to verify the time of blocks without relying on a trusted time source. This mechanism helps Solana achieve high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular platform for decentralized applications.

## Crypto wallets
A crypto wallet is a software program that allows you to store, send, and receive digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency wallets are secured by public and private keys, which are long strings of numbers and letters that serve as unique identifiers for your assets. The public key can be shared with others in order to receive payments, while the private key must be kept secure, as it is used to sign transactions and control access to your funds. Some crypto wallets are designed for use on a desktop computer, while others are designed for use on a mobile device. Some popular cryptocurrency wallets include MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, and Exodus.

### Type of wallets
* **Hot Wallet**:  A hot wallet is connected to the internet and is designed to be used for quick and frequent transactions.

* **Cold Wallet**:  A cold wallet, also known as a hardware wallet, is not connected to the internet and is considered to be more secure for long-term storage of cryptocurrency.

* **Desktop Wallet**:  A desktop wallet is a software application that can be installed on a computer and is used to store, manage, and send cryptocurrencies.

* **Mobile Wallet**:  A mobile wallet is a wallet application installed on a smartphone, which can be used to store, manage, and send cryptocurrencies.

* **Web Wallet**:  A web wallet is a type of hot wallet that can be accessed through a web browser and is typically used for quick and frequent transactions.

* **Multi-Signature Wallet**:  A multi-signature wallet requires multiple signatures or approvals from different users before a transaction can be executed. This type of wallet is often used for shared accounts or for businesses that need to secure their cryptocurrency holdings.
