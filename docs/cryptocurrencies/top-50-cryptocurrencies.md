In the world of cryptocurrency, "market cap" refers to the total value of a particular cryptocurrency that is currently in circulation. It is calculated by multiplying the current market price of a cryptocurrency by its total circulating supply. For example, if a cryptocurrency has a market price of $10 and a circulating supply of 1 million coins, its market cap would be $10 million.
