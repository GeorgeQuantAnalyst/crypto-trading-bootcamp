## [Base information](#cryptocurrencies)

### What are cryptocurrencies?
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate independently of a central bank. They are decentralized and typically built on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions made on the network. The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are many other types of cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. Cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on digital currency exchanges, and can also be used to purchase goods and services online. Transactions made with cryptocurrencies are recorded on a public ledger and are verified by a network of computers, making them more secure and transparent than traditional forms of currency.

### What most used cryptocurrencies?
The most widely used cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, and it remains the largest by market capitalization. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it is known for its smart contract functionality. Tether is a stablecoin, meaning it is pegged to the value of the US dollar, and is often used as a store of value or a means of exchange on cryptocurrency exchanges. Other notable cryptocurrencies include Binance Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP. However, the crypto market is constantly changing and new coins are emerging frequently.

### what are cryptocurrencies used for?
**digital currencies, supply chain management, and voting systems**
Cryptocurrencies are primarily used as a digital medium of exchange. They are decentralized and operate on a blockchain network, which is a distributed ledger technology that records and verifies transactions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to make purchases, transfer money, and store value. They can also be used for more advanced applications such as smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Some people also use cryptocurrencies as an investment, buying and holding them with the expectation that their value will increase over time. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 with the goal of providing a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies.

### What is blockchain?
A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is decentralized and distributed across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction is added to the block, it is broadcast to the entire network. Each block is linked to the block before it and after it, creating a chain of blocks. This creates a transparent and secure way of recording and verifying transactions, as each block in the chain is protected by complex cryptography.

One of the key features of a blockchain is that it is immutable, meaning that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes it a very useful technology for a variety of different applications, such as digital currencies, supply chain management, and voting systems. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, is based on blockchain technology.

### What is smart contract and dapp?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. It is a computer program that automatically executes the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts allow for the automation of processes and can be used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

A decentralized application (dApp) is a type of application that runs on a blockchain network. dApps are decentralized because they are not controlled by any single entity. Instead, they rely on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, typically a blockchain, to run. dApps are open-source and are typically built on top of a blockchain platform like Ethereum. They can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as creating decentralized marketplaces, digital voting systems, and more.

### What is purpose of smart contract in real life?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist over a decentralized, blockchain network.

In real life, smart contracts can be used for a wide range of applications, including financial derivatives, supply chain management, real estate, and more. For example, in supply chain management, a smart contract could be used to automatically release payment to a supplier upon delivery of goods. In real estate, a smart contract could be used to automate the process of transferring ownership of a property. Additionally, smart contracts can be used for voting systems, digital identity, and other applications where secure and transparent record-keeping is important.

## [Bitcoin](#cryptocurrencies)

### What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
Users can also send and receive bitcoins as a form of payment with appropriate wallets. Bitcoin is often referred to as the first cryptocurrency and is considered the most widely used and successful digital currency.

### How work Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions on its network. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is a chain of blocks that contains a record of all Bitcoin transactions.

To use Bitcoin, a user needs to have a digital wallet, which is a software program that stores their Bitcoin balance and allows them to send and receive Bitcoin. When a user wants to make a transaction, they broadcast a message to the network, which includes the details of the transaction, such as the amount of Bitcoin being sent and the address of the recipient's wallet.

Miners on the network then validate the transaction by solving complex mathematical problems, known as proof-of-work. Once a miner has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with a small amount of Bitcoin. This process is called mining.

Bitcoin transactions are processed by a decentralized network of computers, which makes it resistant to censorship and fraud. It also means that no single person or institution controls the currency, which is why it is often referred to as a decentralized digital currency.

### Example purpose of Bitcoin
* One of the main purposes of Bitcoin is to serve as a store of value and medium of exchange, similar to traditional fiat currencies. However, unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized system, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This allows for greater financial freedom and autonomy for individuals and businesses.

* Another purpose of Bitcoin is to act as a hedge against inflation, as the supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, and the rate at which new coins are created is predetermined and decreases over time. Additionally, Bitcoin can also be used as a form of investment, as its price can fluctuate significantly in response to market demand and investor sentiment.

* In terms of how it works, Bitcoin relies on a technology called blockchain, which is a decentralized public ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. Transactions are grouped together in blocks, and each block is linked to the one before it, creating a chain of blocks (hence the name "blockchain"). Miners, who are individuals or organizations that contribute computing power to the network, compete to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In return, they are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.

## [Ethereum](#cryptocurrencies)

### What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Ethereum uses its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), as a medium of exchange for transactions on its network. One of the key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that while Bitcoin is primarily used as a digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a platform for decentralized applications. This means that in addition to being used as a medium of exchange, Ether can also be used to pay for the computational services required to run dApps on the Ethereum network.

### How Ethereum work?
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers.

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a blockchain to record and verify transactions. However, unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily designed as a digital currency, Ethereum is intended to be a platform for building decentralized applications.

The Ethereum blockchain is powered by a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transactions and computational services on the network.

One of the key features of Ethereum is the ability for developers to write and deploy smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These contracts are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and are executed automatically when certain conditions are met.

Ethereum also supports decentralized applications, or dApps, which are applications that run on a blockchain. These dApps can be built using smart contracts, and they are often used to create decentralized versions of traditional applications, such as decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, and games.

Ethereum works on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) where the validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" (or lock up) as collateral. This is different from Bitcoin which uses Proof of Work (PoW) where validators, called "miners," are chosen based on their computational power.

### Example to use ethereum?
One example of how Ethereum can be used is in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These are financial applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain and allow users to perform financial transactions and manage their assets without the need for a centralized intermediary. Some examples of DeFi applications include decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and stablecoins.

Another example of how Ethereum can be used is in the creation and execution of smart contracts. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. Smart contracts can be used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

Additionally, Ethereum can be used to create and run Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are organizations that are run by code and not by people, this is possible through the use of smart contracts in Ethereum.

Overall, Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications, and has the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing trustless, transparent and secure solutions.

## [Crypto sectors](#cryptocurrencies)
Crypto sectors refer to the different areas or industries in which cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are being used or applied. Some examples of crypto sectors include:

* **Payment and transactions**

This sector includes cryptocurrencies that are primarily used as a form of payment or for sending and receiving money, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.

The term "metaverse" is often used to describe the concept of a virtual world or universe that is created and sustained by computer technology. In the context of the cryptocurrency sector, the term "metaverse crypto" generally refers to a subset of digital assets and projects that are focused on building out the infrastructure and applications for decentralized virtual worlds and online communities. This can include things like virtual reality platforms, decentralized marketplaces, and other blockchain-based applications that are designed to enable new forms of social interaction and economic activity in virtual environments.

Examples of projects in the metaverse crypto sector include Decentraland, Somnium Space, and The Sandbox, all of which are decentralized virtual worlds built on the Ethereum blockchain. These platforms allow users to create, buy, and sell virtual real estate, virtual goods, and other digital assets, and also provide a space for social interactions and online communities.

* **NFT**

NFT, which stands for Non-Fungible Token, is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item or piece of content, such as a digital art, video, music, or other types of media. NFTs are typically built on top of blockchain technology, which enables them to be traded and exchanged in a decentralized, trustless manner. Because they are unique and cannot be replaced by another identical item, they are considered non-fungible, which is where the name comes from. The NFT crypto sector is a rapidly growing area within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many creators, artists, and musicians finding ways to monetize their work through NFTs.

* **Web3**

Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, is the next evolution of the internet where users have more control over their data and digital assets, and where decentralized technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts play a major role. The Web 3.0 crypto sector refers to the various blockchain-based projects and protocols that are building the infrastructure and applications for this new decentralized web. This includes decentralized storage, decentralized finance, decentralized identity, and decentralized marketplaces. Some examples of projects in the Web 3.0 crypto sector include Ethereum, IPFS, and 0x Protocol.

* **Layer 1**

The "layer 1" crypto sector refers to the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain network. This includes the protocol and consensus mechanism that ensure the security and integrity of the network, as well as the mechanisms for validating transactions and creating new blocks. Bitcoin, for example, is considered a layer 1 blockchain, as it has its own protocol and consensus mechanism (proof-of-work) that is not built on top of any other blockchain. Ethereum is also considered a layer 1 blockchain, with its own protocol and consensus mechanism (proof-of-stake). Layer 1 blockchain networks are considered the foundation or backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, and they are usually the most secure and decentralized compared to layer 2 or layer 3 solutions.

* **Layer 2**

The layer 2 sector of the cryptocurrency space refers to projects that aim to provide solutions to the scalability and transactional issues faced by layer 1 protocols, while still leveraging their security and decentralization benefits. Layer 2 solutions typically aim to offload some of the computational and transactional demands of layer 1 protocols onto secondary layers of the network, making it possible to handle more transactions and reduce the costs associated with on-chain activity. Some examples of layer 2 solutions include state channels, plasma chains, and rollups. These solutions can be used to power decentralized applications, facilitate faster and cheaper payments, and enable new use cases that may not have been possible with layer 1 protocols alone.

* **Layer 3**

"Layer 3" refers to solutions that are built on top of layer 2 solutions, and aims to provide more advanced functionality to the blockchain. They allow for more complex dApps and use cases. However, Layer 3 solutions are still in development and research phase, and are not yet widely adopted.

## [Mechanism consensus](#cryptocurrencies)
In cryptocurrencies, a consensus mechanism is a method used to achieve agreement among participants in a decentralized network about the current state of the system. The goal of a consensus mechanism is to ensure that all participants in the network have the same view of the ledger, even in the presence of malicious actors or network failures.

### Proof of Work
Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used by some cryptocurrencies to secure their networks and validate transactions. It is based on the idea that a user must perform a certain amount of computational work in order to participate in the network and validate transactions. The computational work involves solving complex mathematical problems that are difficult to perform but easy to verify. Once a user solves the problem, they can add a block to the blockchain and receive a reward for their effort.

The PoW consensus mechanism is used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (prior to transitioning to Proof of Stake), and others. The computational work performed during PoW provides the computational power required to secure the network and validate transactions, making it resistant to malicious attacks such as 51% attacks, where an attacker tries to control the majority of computational power on the network to carry out malicious activities.

### Proof of Stake
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used in some cryptocurrencies as an alternative to Proof of Work (PoW). Unlike PoW, which requires nodes (or "miners") to perform a computational effort in order to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, PoS relies on nodes holding a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to validate transactions and secure the network.

In a PoS system, the node with the most "stake" (or amount of cryptocurrency) is chosen to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, rather than the node that performs the most computational work. The idea behind this is that a node with a large amount of stake has a financial incentive to act honestly and maintain the security of the network, since a malicious node would risk losing its stake.

PoS is often considered to be more energy-efficient than PoW, since it does not require a large amount of computational effort to validate transactions. This makes it an attractive option for cryptocurrencies that are looking to scale and reduce their environmental impact.

### Proof of authority
Proof of Authority (PoA) is a consensus mechanism used in some blockchain networks. In a PoA system, certain designated nodes, or validators, are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. The validators are typically chosen based on their reputation or identity, hence the name "Proof of Authority."

In a PoA system, the validators are trusted to perform their duties in a honest and reliable manner, as they are known and publicly identified entities. This can help ensure a higher level of security compared to proof of work consensus, where the validity of transactions is determined through cryptographic algorithms and computing power.

Proof of Authority can be a good choice for blockchain networks that have a smaller number of participants, as it does not require the same level of computational power as proof of work and can help ensure faster block times and lower energy consumption.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) allows token holders to vote for delegates to make decisions on behalf of the network. This consensus mechanism is designed to be fast, efficient, and secure while enabling the Binance ecosystem to scale and accommodate a large number of transactions.

In the DPoS mechanism, token holders vote for a limited number of delegate nodes, which then validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. The process of creating new blocks and securing the network is done by these delegate nodes, rather than the entire network, making it a more efficient and scalable solution compared to other consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW).

### Proof of Reserve
The Proof of Reserve mechanism is used to ensure that the Tether token is fully backed by US dollars held in reserve. This means that for every Tether token in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve to back it. The Proof of Reserve mechanism provides assurance to Tether users that their tokens can be redeemed for US dollars, making Tether a stablecoin.

### XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol
This consensus mechanism is based on a network of nodes that maintain a distributed ledger of all transactions on the XRP network. Transactions are validated by nodes through a process called consensus, and once a transaction is validated, it is recorded permanently on the ledger. The XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol is designed to be energy efficient, fast, and secure, making it a suitable choice for the XRP cryptocurrency.

### Proof of History
PoH is a time-stamping mechanism that generates a unique, verifiable hash for each block, allowing nodes to verify the time of blocks without relying on a trusted time source. This mechanism helps Solana achieve high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular platform for decentralized applications.

## [Crypto exchanges](#cryptocurrencies)
A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These exchanges act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions by matching orders and executing trades. Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Exchanges can vary in terms of the types of cryptocurrencies they offer, their fees, and the level of security they provide for users' funds. Some exchanges also offer additional features, such as margin trading and derivatives trading.

It's important to note that the crypto markets can be highly volatile and trading futures is considered a high risk activity, so it's important to fully understand the risks involved before trading on these exchanges.

## [Crypto wallets](#cryptocurrencies)
A crypto wallet is a software program that allows you to store, send, and receive digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency wallets are secured by public and private keys, which are long strings of numbers and letters that serve as unique identifiers for your assets. The public key can be shared with others in order to receive payments, while the private key must be kept secure, as it is used to sign transactions and control access to your funds. Some crypto wallets are designed for use on a desktop computer, while others are designed for use on a mobile device. Some popular cryptocurrency wallets include MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, and Exodus.

### Type of wallets
* **Hot Wallet**:  A hot wallet is connected to the internet and is designed to be used for quick and frequent transactions.
