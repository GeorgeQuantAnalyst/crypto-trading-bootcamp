# Asset classes
Published date: 12.2.2023

Asset classes refer to the different types of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and others. Each asset class has its own characteristics and risk/return profile, and investors may choose to allocate their investments among different asset classes to diversify their portfolio and potentially reduce risk. The asset classes can be broadly grouped into two categories: traditional assets (such as stocks, bonds, and cash) and alternative assets (such as real estate, commodities, and hedge funds).

## Stocks
The stock asset class refers to investments made in individual stocks, stock indices, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track a specific stock index. This type of investment allows individuals to own a share of a company and participate in its growth and profits. The stock market is one of the most widely recognized and commonly traded asset classes and has a long history of providing solid returns over the long term. However, investing in individual stocks can be riskier than investing in other asset classes, as the value of a stock can be impacted by various factors such as the performance of the company, economic conditions, and broader market trends. Additionally, it's important to diversify investments across a variety of stocks and other asset classes to reduce risk.

## Commodity
The commodity asset class refers to physical goods that are traded on financial markets, such as agricultural products (such as wheat, corn, and soybeans), precious metals (such as gold and silver), energy products (such as oil and natural gas), and industrial metals (such as copper and aluminum). The prices of these commodities can be influenced by various factors, including supply and demand, natural disasters, and geopolitical events, which can result in significant price volatility. Commodities are often used as a hedge against inflation, as their prices tend to rise when the cost of living increases.

### History
Commodity trading has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations when people traded goods such as spices, grains, and precious metals. During the medieval period, merchants would trade goods in the marketplace, and the modern concept of commodity trading began to emerge in the 17th and 18th centuries with the creation of futures exchanges in Amsterdam and London. These exchanges allowed merchants to hedge their risks by trading futures contracts that locked in the price of a commodity for a future delivery date. Commodity trading continued to evolve and expand over the centuries, with the introduction of new commodities, financial instruments, and regulations. Today, commodity trading is a global industry that encompasses a wide range of commodities, from traditional agricultural products to precious metals, energy products, and even financial instruments.

### Top commodity exchanges

* New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) in the United States

**The S&P GSCI (Standard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index)** is a composite index of 24 commodity futures contracts representing the major commodity markets including energy, agriculture, industrial metals, and precious metals. It is designed to measure the performance of the commodity markets and is widely used as a benchmark for commodity investments.

The prices of these commodities are closely watched and widely followed by traders, investors, and market participants, as they can have a significant impact on the global economy.

### Average daily transaction volume on the commodity market
The average daily transaction volume on the commodity market varies depending on the specific commodity being traded and market conditions.

## Forex
The foreign exchange market, also known as the Forex market, is a decentralized global market where the buying and selling of currencies takes place. It is considered as an asset class because it allows traders and investors to speculate on the exchange rate movements of different currencies. The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and its liquidity is influenced by a variety of economic, political, and social factors. The Forex market is the largest financial market in the world, with an average daily trading volume of over $5.3 trillion. Forex trading can be done through a broker, and it is a popular asset class for those looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially generate income from currency price movements.

### History
The history of Forex trading can be traced back to the ancient times when people first started trading currencies for goods and services. In the past, currency was often based on gold or silver, and the exchange rate between two currencies was determined by the amount of gold or silver that was equivalent in value. However, with the advent of paper money, the exchange rate became more complex and was based on a variety of factors, including the supply and demand for each currency.

During the 20th century, the growth of international trade and investment led to the development of the modern foreign exchange market. In 1971, the Bretton Woods system was abandoned, and the value of currencies was allowed to float freely against each other. This marked the beginning of the modern Forex market, and today, it is the largest financial market in the world, with an average daily trading volume of over $5 trillion.

Forex trading has become increasingly accessible in recent years, with the development of online trading platforms that allow individuals to participate in the market from anywhere in the world. This has made Forex trading more popular and has opened up new opportunities for investors to take advantage of changes in currency exchange rates..

### Decentralized market
Forex market is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single exchange or organization. Instead, it is composed of a network of individuals, banks, and other financial institutions that trade currencies between each other. As a result, there is no central authority that can accurately track the traded volume for the entire forex market. However, some of the largest forex brokers, such as IG Group, CMC Markets, and Forex.com, are known for offering forex trading services to a large number of clients globally.

### Most famous Forex indexes on world
In the Forex market, there is no widely used stock index equivalent. Instead, the Forex market is primarily dominated by exchange rates between different currencies. Some of the most widely watched and traded currency pairs include the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF. These currency pairs are closely watched by traders and investors as they can provide insight into the strength of different economies and can be used as a barometer for the health of the global economy. Additionally, central bank policy decisions and other macroeconomic indicators can also play a major role in determining exchange rates between currencies.

* **US Dollar index (DXY)**: is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major foreign currencies. The six currencies that make up the dollar index are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. The dollar index is calculated by taking the weighted average of the exchange rates between the US dollar and each of the six currencies. The dollar index is widely used as a benchmark for the strength of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market and as a gauge of the US dollar's performance against other currencies.

### Most traded forex pairs
The most traded currency pairs in the forex market are typically referred to as the "majors". The majors include the EUR/USD (Euro/U.S. Dollar), USD/JPY (U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen), GBP/USD (British Pound/U.S. Dollar), USD/CHF (U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc), USD/CAD (U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar), and AUD/USD (Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar). These currency pairs account for a large portion of the total forex market volume and are considered to be the most liquid currency pairs in the market.

### Average daily transaction volume on the Forex market
The average daily transaction volume on the Forex market is estimated to be over $5.3 trillion. This makes the Forex market the largest financial market in the world, dwarfing the stock market in terms of trading volume. Forex trading is decentralized, with most trades being executed through electronic means such as online trading platforms and electronic communication networks (ECNs). The high level of liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the Forex market means that there is always a high level of trading activity, making it an attractive market for both retail and institutional investors. However, it is also a market that can be very volatile, and traders must be mindful of the risks involved.

## Bonds
Bonds are a type of debt security that represent a loan made by an investor to an entity such as a corporation or government. In exchange for lending money, the investor receives periodic interest payments, known as coupon payments, and expects to receive their principal back at maturity. Bonds are considered a fixed income asset class, meaning that they generate a predictable stream of income. The price of a bond can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer, but its coupon payments remain the same. Because they offer a reliable income stream and are generally considered less risky than stocks, bonds are often used as a diversification tool in investment portfolios.

### History
The history of the bonds market can be traced back to the 17th century, when governments began issuing bonds to finance wars and other expenditures. The first modern bonds were issued by the Bank of England in the 1690s to fund its ongoing wars with France. In the United States, the first bonds were issued by the federal government in the late 18th century to finance the American Revolution.

The bond market has evolved over the years, growing in size and complexity as the global economy has expanded. Today, bonds are issued by governments, corporations, and other entities and are used to finance a wide range of activities, including infrastructure projects, research and development, and capital expenditures. The bond market is now a global market, with investors from around the world participating in the buying and selling of bonds.

The bond market is a crucial component of the global financial system, providing a source of long-term financing for governments, corporations, and other borrowers. The market is also an important indicator of economic health, reflecting investor sentiment about interest rates, inflation, and other economic factors.

### Top bond exchanges
The most famous bond exchanges in the world include the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The NYSE is one of the largest bond exchanges in the world, with a wide range of bonds traded on its platform, including corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds, and others. Other major bond exchanges around the world include the Euronext, the Deutsche Börse, and the Swiss Stock Exchange, among others.

### Most famous bond indexes on world
Some of the most famous bond indexes in the world include the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index, and the Citigroup World Government Bond Index. These indexes track the performance of various bond markets and are used as benchmarks for the performance of individual bonds, bond funds, and other fixed income investments. The bond market is a large and complex marketplace, and these indexes help investors understand the performance of various segments of the market, as well as the overall health of the bond market.

### Most traded bonds
The most traded bonds in the world vary depending on a number of factors, including the state of the economy, interest rate trends, and geopolitical events. Some of the most commonly traded bonds include U.S. Treasury bonds, which are considered to be among the safest and most liquid bonds in the world, as well as corporate bonds issued by large, creditworthy companies. Other widely traded bonds include municipal bonds, which are issued by state and local governments, and high-yield bonds, which offer higher yields but come with a higher degree of risk. The exact composition of the most traded bonds can change over time, so it's important to stay up to date on current market conditions.

### Average daily transaction volume on the bond market
Average daily transaction volume in the bond market varies greatly and depends on various factors such as market conditions, the size and liquidity of the bond market, and more. Additionally, it is difficult to provide an exact figure as the bond market is not a centralized exchange, and there is no single entity that tracks its volume. Bond trading typically takes place over-the-counter (OTC) rather than on centralized exchanges, which makes it more challenging to measure the size and volume of the market. Bond market is often less liquid than the stock market.

## Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. They can be traded and used as a medium of exchange just like traditional fiat currencies, but they are decentralized and operate on a distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by market demand and supply, and they are subject to volatility. The cryptocurrency market is still relatively new and its regulatory status is evolving, so it carries a higher level of risk compared to more established asset classes like stocks, bonds, and commodities. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a new asset class for investment purposes, and the market continues to grow.

### History
Cryptocurrencies have a relatively short but rapidly evolving history. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin's decentralized, secure and transparent nature made it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies, and it quickly gained a following among individuals and organizations who saw potential in its use as a digital store of value and means of payment.

Since the creation of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and use cases. Some of these cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, have gained significant popularity and have been used to build decentralized applications and smart contracts. Others, like Ripple and Litecoin, have been developed with specific goals and features, such as faster transaction times or improved privacy.

Despite their relative youth, cryptocurrencies have already had a significant impact on the financial world and are being increasingly adopted by individuals, organizations, and even governments around the world. As the market for cryptocurrencies continues to grow, it is likely that we will see further developments and innovations in the space, and the role of cryptocurrencies in the global financial system will continue to evolve.

Real estate investment can take many forms, including residential and commercial properties, such as apartments, office buildings, retail centers, and warehouses, as well as other real estate assets like land or infrastructure. Investors in real estate can benefit from rental income, appreciation in property values, and other passive income streams, although real estate investments also come with risks, such as fluctuating property values, market trends, and other economic conditions.

### History
The history of real estate as an asset class dates back to ancient civilizations, where land and property were used as a form of wealth and a means of exchange. Over time, the concept of real estate as an investment evolved to include not just land, but also buildings and other structures. In the 19th and 20th centuries, real estate became more industrialized and institutionalized, with the development of large-scale commercial and residential properties, as well as the creation of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other investment vehicles. Today, real estate is a widely recognized asset class and plays a key role in the portfolios of many individual and institutional investors. Real estate is often valued based on its potential to generate income through rent or lease payments, as well as its potential for capital appreciation over time.

### What are types of real estate?
* **Residential real estate**: Any property used for residential purposes. Examples include single-family homes, condos, cooperatives, duplexes, townhouses, and multifamily residences.

* **Commercial real estate**: Any property used exclusively for business purposes, such as apartment complexes, gas stations, grocery stores, hospitals, hotels, offices, parking facilities, restaurants, shopping centers, stores, and theaters.

* **Industrial real estate**: Any property used for manufacturing, production, distribution, storage, and research and development.

* **Land**: Includes undeveloped property, vacant land, and agricultural lands such as farms, orchards, ranches, and timberland.

* **Special purpose**: Property used by the public, such as cemeteries, government buildings, libraries, parks, places of worship, and schools.
